# How to Run This Project

This repository contains four interactive Python notebooks designed for different aspects of our experiments:

- `EK_feature_extraction.ipynb`
- `EK_Classifiers.ipynb`
- `EK_features_plot.ipynb`
- `AML_AN.ipynb`

## Overview

### EK_feature_extraction.ipynb
This notebook extracts RGB features from the Epic Kitchen dataset. It supports various configurations based on:
- Number of frames (5, 10, 25)
- Sampling strategies (dense, uniform)
- Training methods (pretrained, fine-tuned)

### EK_Classifiers.ipynb
This notebook details the performance of different classifiers based on various configurations. It provides a deeper analysis of our classification results.

### EK_features_plot.ipynb
This notebook includes visualizations to help analyze the extracted features from different configurations. It provides plots for a comprehensive analysis.

### AML_AN.ipynb
This notebook covers preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification tasks for the ActionNet dataset. It includes:
- Classifiers for EMG data
- Training of the Variational Autoencoder
- Multimodal classifiers

## Notes
We have made the code as clear as possible, with comments providing a high-level understanding of our objectives. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, utilizing visualizations and classification outcomes to evaluate our findings.
